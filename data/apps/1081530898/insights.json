I hope this lasts problem is a temporary malfunction otherwise I will seriously have to cancel my subscription. BTW I have been a subscriber for many years and I would miss the magazine, just not sure it’s worth the headache. I would revert to print if I could but I travel a lot. The app, if it worked, would be a perfect solution for my needs. Too bad it doesn’t!\n\nWanted to update after the developer’s response: I have indeed contacted the technical support team several times and was appalled at the lack of resolution. For the most part it seems no one even bothers to read the requests to find out what the problems are. \nMy conclusion is the app is poorly designed and the support is lacking.",

One is that it constantly signs you out. Even though I read it every day, I am often met with a ‘Subscription not found’ error message forcing me to log back in. Second is the search function. It is sometimes impossible to find a story, and one is required to go to google, search it there and then have the browser open in the app. A third is that it selects the main page stories for you, but there is no simple way to see stories in order of publication so it becomes very easy to miss stories, particularly online-only ones. Finally, unlike other apps, the sections are too broad.  So, for instance, all culture is lumped instead of dividing by medium. A reader looking specifically for film stories would want to find both features and reviews on cinema, but there is no such ordering in this app. I don’t mean to be super harsh because the reading experience itself is good, but you would hope the app of such an expensive magazine would be less glitchy in account management and more useful in navigation of content.",

The main issue is that finding articles is basically impossible with their search function. Even when I type the title of the exact article I want to read I get search results from articles that contain any instance of any words in the title. With no sense either, it doesn’t return by most recent or closet association. Fine, I might be able to deal with that if I could at least view all works written by a particular author. But that’s not possible either. So essentially the app is a worse way to read only the most recent articles. Once they leave the Top Stories tab, good luck finding them. The web version of The New Yorker does not have these problems really. Or I can at least look at all the works of a writer. So I don’t understand why if I’m paying for the app I get a much worse experience. I suppose their digital is an afterthought, but it’s a shame. Like I said the idea of an app where I can explore all their works with ease, sounds amazing. But it’s just not the case. I won’t be resubscribing when the renewal comes.",

One is that it constantly signs you out. Even though I read it every day, I am often met with a ‘Subscription not found’ error message forcing me to log back in. Second is the search function. It is sometimes impossible to find a story, and one is required to go to google, search it there and then have the browser open in the app. A third is that it selects the main page stories for you, but there is no simple way to see stories in order of publication so it becomes very easy to miss stories, particularly online-only ones. Finally, unlike other apps, the sections are too broad.  So, for instance, all culture is lumped instead of dividing by medium. A reader looking specifically for film stories would want to find both features and reviews on cinema, but there is no such ordering in this app. I don’t mean to be super harsh because the reading experience itself is good, but you would hope the app of such an expensive magazine would be less glitchy in account management and more useful in navigation of content.",

So many problems., so much frustration. Before it was not able to get audio like the New Yorker Radio Hour and other problems. Condé Nast and the New Yorker are HANDS OFF with this third party app. I’ve asked for a refund and canceled. I suggest getting the digital magazine directly through the New Yorker website. Maybe that will work better.",

I used to listen to all available articles while commuting. One of the best features (besides the excellent writing) was high/quality narration. It could even draw me into to stories that I didn't think I'd be interested in. Recently more and more of the articles are rest by automated voices and I can't stand it. I keep trying, but inevitably switch it off 5 minutes in because the sound is so annoying. Please bring back human narrators!!",

There is no native feature for sizing text, it says to use the device text size setting, but they don’t work. There is no dark mode that could help. There is no zoom, nothing to aid in ease of reading, which as a dedicated reading app it’s ridiculous!! It’s a shame that this app  is so inaccessible to sight challenged individuals.",
