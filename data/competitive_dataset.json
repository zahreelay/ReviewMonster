It is plagued with a seemingly endless onslaught of annoying bugs - most consistently, whenever you close the app, it exits the article and does not save your place so you have to then find the article again and then find your place to take up where you left off. It also decides to sign you out of your account at least twice a week and force you to go through the bureaucratic horrors of logging in again (extra fun when you are on a plane or other places without cell service). Then there are lots of exciting little bugs that whimsically appear and disappear. Most recently, every article just turned into a blank, empty endless scroll with no words after about three sentences. It might be a conflict of interest but I do think the psychology of what keeps us coming back to this awful experience would be a great subject for Jia Tolentino‘s next piece.",

It is plagued with a seemingly endless onslaught of annoying bugs - most consistently, whenever you close the app, it exits the article and does not save your place so you have to then find the article again and then find your place to take up where you left off. It also decides to sign you out of your account at least twice a week and force you to go through the bureaucratic horrors of logging in again (extra fun when you are on a plane or other places without cell service). Then there are lots of exciting little bugs that whimsically appear and disappear. Most recently, every article just turned into a blank, empty endless scroll with no words after about three sentences. It might be a conflict of interest but I do think the psychology of what keeps us coming back to this awful experience would be a great subject for Jia Tolentino‘s next piece.",

Facts have given way to partisan talking points, with coverage increasingly indistinguishable from Democratic Party messaging and the fashionable dogmas of socialist, secular elites. Editorial honor is gone. Rigor is gone. In its place are shallow, unverified hit pieces aimed not at informing readers, but at harming Trump, Religious, children and scolding the country that built it.\n\nI say this with real sadness. I have read this paper for nearly forty years, and watching its steady abandonment of intellectual honesty, economic literacy, and even basic respect for its readers has been painful. What was once a mighty institution now seems content to trade credibility for applause from people who would have mocked it a generation ago. The Wall Street Journal didn’t lose the battle —it surrendered.   (Maybe it is the Neville Chamberlain of papers)",

For example, when it opens, it displays the previous day’s edition, not the current one. Second, it remains very slow to open page 1 (tho possibly not AS slow as it was). Articles are opening more consistently-previously, you could try to open an article and it would just freeze-that seems better. Fact remains, what was a smooth running, reliable and pleasurable experience has been significantly degraded. They keep talking about “improving” the product but if they were serious, they would go back to square one.\n\nAddendum:\nThey’re at it again, fiddling with the app and making it extremely frustrating to use-it freezes, cuts out and slows to a crawl. After reboots, shut downs and restarts it reverts to the older version of the app which works flawlessly. You think there’s a lesson in that? Very disappointing.",

The app uses 2GB+ of storage even when there are no saved articles — and there is no way to clear the cache (the only way to remedy the issue is to delete the app periodically). 3. Every time you navigate to another app (e.g. Safari), the WSJ reloads and you lose the article you’re reading and where you are in the article. This last one is especially egregious because Apple has a standard way for applications to be coded to “hold their place” when you navigate to another iOS app. For reference, I have plenty of storage and memory on my iPhone and this problem only occurs with the WSJ app.",

Facts have given way to partisan talking points, with coverage increasingly indistinguishable from Democratic Party messaging and the fashionable dogmas of socialist, secular elites. Editorial honor is gone. Rigor is gone. In its place are shallow, unverified hit pieces aimed not at informing readers, but at harming Trump, Religious, children and scolding the country that built it.\n\nI say this with real sadness. I have read this paper for nearly forty years, and watching its steady abandonment of intellectual honesty, economic literacy, and even basic respect for its readers has been painful. What was once a mighty institution now seems content to trade credibility for applause from people who would have mocked it a generation ago. The Wall Street Journal didn’t lose the battle —it surrendered.   (Maybe it is the Neville Chamberlain of papers)",

Articles are opening more consistently-previously, you could try to open an article and it would just freeze-that seems better. Fact remains, what was a smooth running, reliable and pleasurable experience has been significantly degraded. They keep talking about “improving” the product but if they were serious, they would go back to square one.\n\nAddendum:\nThey’re at it again, fiddling with the app and making it extremely frustrating to use-it freezes, cuts out and slows to a crawl.

The app uses 2GB+ of storage even when there are no saved articles — and there is no way to clear the cache (the only way to remedy the issue is to delete the app periodically). 3. Every time you navigate to another app (e.g. Safari), the WSJ reloads and you lose the article you’re reading and where you are in the article. This last one is especially egregious because Apple has a standard way for applications to be coded to “hold their place” when you navigate to another iOS app. For reference, I have plenty of storage and memory on my iPhone and this problem only occurs with the WSJ app.",

Either offer two tier of subscriptions, a cheaper one with ads and a more expensive one without, or get rid of them entirely. \n\nThe ads also aren’t incorporated into the app well. The content loads before the ads so you’ll begin reading and then the ads will finish loading and will scroll your view. Very annoying. \n\nBut most annoying of all, 75% of the time I enter an article, the content will disappear from the page after around 10 seconds of being in the article. The only thing to do is leave the article and reenter. Though most of the time it will only disappear again requiring you to repeat the process.",

The NYT used to provide a \"both sides\" perspective on the lynching of Black Americans in 20th century, The Atlantic has shamelessly carried this abominable torch into the 21st century.\n\nAnd this is just a single issue; the money they make from their obvious duplicity must be truly extraordinary.\n\nThis entire publication disgusts me. I am a high school social studies teacher and this publication is everything that is wrong with this world. It is an insult to the very idea of journalism and humanity. It may not be in this lifetime, but these cowards will one day be known for their evil.",
